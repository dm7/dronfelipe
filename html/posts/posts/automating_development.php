<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
  If you have an Android phone with location services turned on, whenever your phone is connected to the internet it sends <b>location history records</b> to Google's servers, one per minute. This is true of Microsoft's and Apple's phones as well. These records contain three important fields: <code>latitude</code>, <code>longitude</code>, and <code>timestamp</code>. If your phone is usually with you, these records give a very complete picture of where you were at any time in the past.
